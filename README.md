Some utilities for the development of socket.io applications with Inversify.

## Installation

You can install `inversify-socket-utils` using npm:

```sh
npm install inversify inversify-socket-utils reflect-metadata --save
```

The `inversify-socket-utils` type definitions are included in the npm module and require TypeScript 2.0.
Please refer to the [InversifyJS documentation](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS#installation) to learn more about the installation process.

## How to use

Step 1: Create a controller.

```ts
import { injectable } from "inversify";
import { Controller, Payload, ConnectedSocket, OnConnect, OnDisconnect, OnMessage } from "inversify-socket-utils";
import "reflect-metadata";

@injectable()
@Controller(
  '/namespace'
)
export class MessageController {
  @OnConnect("connection")
    connection() {
      console.log("Client connected");
    }

    @OnDisconnect("disconnect")
    disconnect() {
      console.log("Client disconnected");
    }

    @OnMessage("message")
    message(@Payload() payload: any, @ConnectedSocket() socket: any) {
      console.log("Message received");
      socket.emit("message", "Hello!");
    }
}

```

Step 2: Configure container and server.

Configure the inversify container in your composition root as usual.

Then, pass the container to the InversifySocketServer constructor. This will allow it to register all controllers and their dependencies from your container and attach them to the socket.io app.
Then just call server.build() to prepare your app.

In order for the InversifySocketServer to find your controllers, you must bind them to the `TYPE.Controller` service identifier and tag the binding with the controller's name.

```ts
import * as http from "http";
import * as SocketIO from "socket.io";
import { Container } from "inversify";
import { Interfaces, InversifySocketServer, TYPE } from "inversify-socket-utils";
import { MessageController } from "./controllers/message";

let container = new Container();

container.bind<Interfaces.Controller>(TYPE.Controller).to(MessageController);

let app = http.createServer();

let io = new SocketIO.Server(app);
let server = new InversifySocketServer(container, io);
server.build();

app.listen(3000);
console.log(`Server is listening on port 3000`);

```
